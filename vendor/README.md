## Project: CAPS

### Author: Steven Rejdukowski

### Problem Domain

CAPS Phase 1: Begin the build of an application for a product called CAPS - The Code Academy Parcel Service. In this sprint, weâ€™ll build out a system that emulates a real world supply chain. CAPS will simulate a delivery service where vendors (such a flower shops) will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, each vendor will be notified that their customers received what they purchased.
